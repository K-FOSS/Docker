# Programs/Socat

[GitHub](https://github.com/K-FOSS/Docker-Images/tree/master/Programs/Socat)

This is a `FROM scratch` Docker image with the latest version of [socat](dest-unreach.org/socat/) from http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/download/

## Usage

This should be able to be used just like you would use the Socat CLI just replace `socat` with `docker run -it kristianfoss/programs-socat` and expose ports and volumes as needed.
